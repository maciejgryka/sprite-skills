# Sprite Skills

This repo contains agent skills to set up [Sprites](https://sprites.dev/) for Phoenix/LiveView development.

To get started, tell Claude:

```
Close this repo git@github.com:maciejgryka/sprite-skills.git Then, install the skills for Claude by symlinking all available skills into Claude's skill directory (`~/.claude/skills/` be default). At this point, the user needs to restart the Claude session (so all new skills are loaded) and run the "setup-sprite-phoenix" skill to finish setup.
```
